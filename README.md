# haplotype_network
A newly updated haplotype network analysis code is now available for R language, which is very convenient and easy to use.
You can directly use this code to draw haplotype networks without tedious data processing by downloading the genotype files of the target gene from the RFGB webpage (https://www.rmbreeding.cn/Index). It is very convenient and easy to use.
